# Next_Character_Predictor

Predicts the next character in the sequence to form a meaningful sentence or word

The dataset for training this model is same as the one used for training the sentiment analysis model

This repository will contain the notebook which is used for predicting the next character in the sequence

But it will also contain some other files, which will help enhancing the models output, and also some files which will help in performing the pre-processing steps of 'next_word_predictor' as well, though the actual model required for training will most probably be very different, in the sense that it will need more lstm or/and dense layers, with larger number of neurons in the embedding layer, or may be some other additional layers.
